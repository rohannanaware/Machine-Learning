Automated feature engineering, like many topics in machine learning, is a complex subject built upon a foundation of simpler ideas. By going through these ideas one at a time, we can build up our understanding of how featuretools which will later allow for us to get the most out of it.\n",

    "### Deep Feature Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) is the process featuretools uses to make new features. DFS stacks feature primitives to form features with a \"depth\" equal to the number of primitives. For example, if we take the maximum value of a client's previous loans (say MAX(previous.loan_amount)), that is a \"deep feature\" with a depth of 1. To create a feature with a depth of two, we could stack primitives by taking the maximum value of a client's average montly payments per previous loan (such as MAX(previous(MEAN(installments.payment)))). The original paper on automated feature engineering using deep feature synthesis is worth a read.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform DFS in featuretools, we use the dfs function passing it an entityset, the target_entity (where we want to make the features), the agg_primitives to use, the trans_primitives to use and the max_depth of the features. Here we will use the default aggregation and transformation primitives, a max depth of 2, and calculate primitives for the app entity. Because this process is computationally expensive, we can run the function using features_only = True to return only a list of the features and not calculate the features themselves. This can be useful to look at the resulting features before starting an extended computation."
